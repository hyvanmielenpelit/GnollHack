/* The weapon_strategy flag is used two ways:
 * 1) When calling mon_wield_item, is 2-6 depending on what is desired.
 * 2) Between calls to mon_wield_item, is 0 or 1 depending on whether or not
 *    the weapon is known by the monster to be cursed (so it shouldn't bother
 *    trying for another weapon).
 * I originally planned to also use 0 if the monster already had its best
 * weapon, to avoid the overhead of a call to mon_wield_item, but it turns out
 * that there are enough situations which might make a monster change its
 * weapon that this is impractical.  --KAA
