# GnollHack

**GnollHack** is a remastered and enhanced version of the classic roguelike game [NetHack](https://github.com/NetHack/NetHack).

## What Is NetHack?

NetHack is one of the most revered roguelikes in gaming history. Released in 1987 and developed evere since, it stood out for its:
- **Incredible Depth**: Every object, monster, and environment has complex, interwoven interactions.
- **Dynamic Gameplay**: No two runs are the same, thanks to procedurally generated dungeons filled with mysteries, traps, and treasures.
- **Humor and Charm**: With witty messages, pop-culture references, and quirky mechanics, NetHack turned dungeon crawling into a delightfully unexpected adventure.
- **Challenge and Reward**: Its high difficulty and permadeath system made every victory hard-earned and deeply satisfying.

However, NetHack's ASCII graphics and steep learning curve could feel daunting for modern players.
