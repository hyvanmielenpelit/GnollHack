# GnollHack

**GnollHack** is a free roguelike game that blends the deep, rewarding gameplay of the classic **NetHack** with modern conveniences, creating an experience that's perfect for both veterans of the genre and newcomers accustomed to contemporary games.

## What Made NetHack Legendary?
NetHack is one of the most revered roguelikes in gaming history. Released in 1987, it stood out for its:
- **Incredible Depth**: Every object, monster, and environment has complex, interwoven interactions. Need to get rid of a cursed item? Try dipping it into holy water. The possibilities are endless.
- **Dynamic Gameplay**: No two runs are the same, thanks to procedurally generated dungeons filled with mysteries, traps, and treasures.
- **Humor and Charm**: With witty messages, pop-culture references, and quirky mechanics, NetHack turned dungeon crawling into a delightfully unexpected adventure.
- **Challenge and Reward**: Its high difficulty and permadeath system made every victory hard-earned and deeply satisfying.

However, NetHack's ASCII graphics and steep learning curve could feel daunting, especially for modern players accustomed to intuitive interfaces.

## Why GnollHack Stands Out for Modern Players
GnollHack takes everything that's great about NetHack and refines it for today’s gamers:

- **Modernized Interface**: With a clean, user-friendly design and touch controls, GnollHack is intuitive to play, making the classic roguelike formula more accessible than ever.
- **Enhanced Visuals**: Unlike NetHack’s traditional ASCII graphics, GnollHack offers polished visuals that help bring its whimsical world to life while staying true to the original’s charm.
- **Rich Customization**: Tailor your experience with modern gameplay options, difficulty settings, and accessibility features. 
- **Faithful Yet Evolved**: GnollHack retains NetHack’s legendary complexity while smoothing out frustrating mechanics, ensuring it’s challenging without being inaccessible.
- **Modern Platform Support**: Compatible with modern operating systems, including Android, iOS, and Windows.
