# GnollHack

**GnollHack** is a remastered and enhanced version of the classic roguelike game [NetHack](https://github.com/NetHack/NetHack).

## What Made NetHack Legendary?
NetHack is one of the most revered roguelikes in gaming history. Released in 1987 and developed evere since, it stood out for its:
- **Incredible Depth**: Every object, monster, and environment has complex, interwoven interactions. Need to get rid of a cursed item? Try dipping it into holy water. The possibilities are endless.
- **Dynamic Gameplay**: No two runs are the same, thanks to procedurally generated dungeons filled with mysteries, traps, and treasures.
- **Humor and Charm**: With witty messages, pop-culture references, and quirky mechanics, NetHack turned dungeon crawling into a delightfully unexpected adventure.
- **Challenge and Reward**: Its high difficulty and permadeath system made every victory hard-earned and deeply satisfying.

However, NetHack's ASCII graphics and steep learning curve could feel daunting, especially for modern players accustomed to modern interfaces.

## Why GnollHack Stands Out for Modern Players?
GnollHack takes everything that's great about NetHack and refines it for today’s gamers:
- **Modernized Interface**: With a user-friendly design and touch controls, GnollHack is intuitive to play, making the classic roguelike formula more accessible than ever.
- **Enhanced Visuals**: Unlike NetHack’s traditional ASCII graphics, GnollHack offers polished visuals.
- **Sounds, Music, and Voiceovers**: GnollHack's rich sound design brings the dungeon alive and improves your immersion to the game.
- **In-Game Hints and Gameplay Advice**: Built right into the game, contextual hints and informative manuals teach a beginning adventurer the basics of the game.
- **Difficulty Levels**: Difficulty levels allow both a beginner and a veteran play the same game at a difficulty that is appropriate for their skills.
- **In-Game Item and Monster Information**: Item and monster stats are baked right into the game. There's no need to check them in an online wiki.
- **More Items and Item Slots**: In NetHack, you usually end up with one "ascension kit," but in GnollHack you have more viable options for your equipment in the late game.
- **More Late-Game Monsters**: NetHack had only very few dangerous late-game monsters, but GnollHack offers a large roster of end-game baddies.
- **Modern Platform Support**: GnollHack is compatible with modern operating systems, including Android, iOS, and Windows.
